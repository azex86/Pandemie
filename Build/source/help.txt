Pandemie is a C++/Python program to simulate pandemics.

Pandemie --[options] [rule]=[value] ...

Options:
	-h, --help            show this help message and exit

	--save [file(.csv)]=> define a name of the file to save the statistics
	--nbthread [int] => define the number of thread to use to execute the calculations not usable
	--show => show the simulation
	--show-chunk => show the chunks
	--stop-when-pandemic-end => stop the simulation when the pandemic is over
	--no-stop-when-pandemic-end => do not stop the simulation when the pandemic is over
	--no-show => do not show the simulation
	--no-graph => do not show the graph
	--graph  => show the graph
	--graph-script [file(.py)] : python main.py => define the command of the script to use to show the graph
	--size-map [int] [int] : 1000 1000 => define the size of the map

	rules available : 
		wait_time, live, counter[All], counter[Infected], counter[Normal], counter[Recovered], counter[Died], rules[infection_time], rules[infection_range], rules[infection_rate], rules[immunity_time]
		
		wait_time : 50 : time to wait between each iteration in milliseconds
		live : 2 : 1 to continue execution, 2 to pause, 0 to stop
		counter[All] : default 10000 : total number of people the sum of all others counter should be counter[All]
		counter[Infected] : 1 : number of infected people
		counter[Normal] : 9999 : number of healthy people
		counter[Recovered] : 0 : number of people healed
		counter[Died] : 0 : number of people dead
		rules[infection_time] : 300 : time to heal after infection
		rules[infection_range] : 2 : contamination distance
		rules[infection_rate] : 1 : contamination probability
		rules[immunity_time] : 900 : time to lose immunity
		rules[quarantine] : 0 : probability of confinement
		rules[confinement] : 0 : probability of confinement
		rules[quarantine_time] : 15 : time between infection and quarantine
		walls : list of walls in the form of a list [wall,,,,] and wall in the form pos.x:pos.y:size.x:size.y
